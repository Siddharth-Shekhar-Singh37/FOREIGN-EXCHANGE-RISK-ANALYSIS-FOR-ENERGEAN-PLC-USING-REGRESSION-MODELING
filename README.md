# FOREIGN-EXCHANGE-RISK-ANALYSIS-FOR-ENERGEAN-PLC-USING-REGRESSION-MODELING
Conducted comprehensive analysis to assess Energean PLC’s exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations using 
multiple regression model. Key variables analyzed included FTSE market index, GBP/USD, GBP/EUR exchange rates. 
Utilized Bloomberg Terminal for stock prices, market index and exchange rate data; sourced risk-free rates from Bank of 
England. Converted data into log returns for analysis. Performed regression analysis, hypothesis testing and  econometric 
diagnostic checks for heteroscedasticity, multicollinearity, autocorrelation and normality of residuals. The model explained 
87% of stock return variance, showed strong market and currency impact on Energean’s stock. Key tools used were 
Bloomberg Terminal, R and Excel for data collection, data analysis and data modelling. Key skills applied include data
